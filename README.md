# Rubber Bullet SMG Script (Standalone) for FiveM

This standalone Lua script adds a non-lethal rubber bullet SMG for FiveM roleplay servers. The weapon does not deal health damage, but after approximately 10 hits, the targeted player will be ragdolled and their screen will blur temporarily. This allows police officers to subdue suspects without using lethal force, creating more immersive and realistic roleplay scenarios.
